# Architecture

This snapshot keeps the original project layout and focuses on a minimal demo flow.

- Backend API: FastAPI in `backend_api/`
- Database: Postgres with PostGIS + pgvector via Docker
- AI utilities: `ai_modeling/`
- Frontend: `frontend_app/` (not required for the demo)

See `README.md` for the quickstart.
